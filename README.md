# üì¶ My Full-Stack App with React & Firebase

A full-stack web application built with **React.js** on the front-end and **Firebase** on the back-end for authentication, database management, and hosting. This project demonstrates various web development concepts such as CRUD operations, user authentication, and real-time database integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (Email/Password)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**  
If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you can fully control them.  
You don't have to use `eject`, but it's there if you want to.
